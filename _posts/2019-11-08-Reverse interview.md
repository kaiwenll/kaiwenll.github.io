# Reverse interview

This is a list of questions which may be interesting to a tech job applicant.
The points are not ordered and many may not apply to a given position, or work type.
It was started as my personal list of questions, which grew over time to include both things I'd like to see more of and red flags which I'd like to avoid.
I've also noticed how few questions were asked by people I interviewed and I think those were missed opportunities.

If you asked something not listed here, send in a PR.

## Expected usage

- Check which questions are interesting for you specifically
- Check which answers you can find yourself online
- Otherwise ask

Definitely don't try to ask everything from the list. (Respect the interviewer's time and show initiative by finding answers on your own if they're already published)

Remember that things tend to be fluid, re-organizations happens often.
Having a bug tracking system doesn't make bug handling efficient and CI/CD doesn't mean your time to deliver is necessarily short.
